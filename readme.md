# TGBot
## Custom bot for Telegram using [Telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot) and [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)

The bot is currently in development. As of now it replies with the messages sent in the chat it participates in. It supports some
custom commands, although they are still under development.
 
Ideally, the bot will be able to butler in chats and store chat metrics while preserving user privacy. It will be able to provide
detailed information regarding user activity in the group, as well as provide some other services, such as sending memes etc.
### Current TO-DO bullet list:
* Implement storing chat statistics
* Implement personalized butlering features

If you wish to fork and use this bot, bear in mind that the file memegetter.py (which supplies memes from reddit) relies on a txt file
with reddit credentials and bot secrets, which for obvious reasons is not present in this repository. It's also worth noting that the bot will be personalized to accomodate the needs of the group it's made for.

Feel free to copy, modify and distribute this piece of software in any way you see fit.
